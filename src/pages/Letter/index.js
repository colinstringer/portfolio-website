      <h1>My web dev job search adventure</h1>
      <p>
        I'd like to start off by talking a bit about my programming journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a kid I was already interested in computers. It started as with most
        kids with the joy of video games. First by just playing them, but later
        when my brother told me he was learning to build his own games, I,
        naturally, had to get in on the action as well. I was 14 when I started
        creating my first games.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the biggest high school project (profielwerkstuk) I programmed a
        game in Java, which I had mostly taught myself. I worked on that project
        for about a year.
      </p>
      <p>
        After high school I decided to study International Game Architecture and
        Design. However, I did not finish that first year due to a special
        reason. I dedicated my life to become a christian that year. And
        creating games nor programming was no longer a part of my life. Over the
        years though, through certain experiences and encounters with people, my
        beliefs gradually fell away. In 2016 I could no longer call myself a
        christian.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not coincidentally, during that time my interest in programming
        resurfaced. I applied myself to study computer science in the best HBO
        of Holland. Avans hogeschool in Den Bosch. I enjoyed that year a lot,
        finished the first year with an average score of 8.8, and cum laude.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that year I felt the urge to travel, live abroad while I'm still
        young. Studies can always continue later on. So I did.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I came back from my travels instead of continuing my studies I
        tried to start a web design business. I thought it should be simple
        enough if I started off by learning some wordpress design. And it was.
        Within a few months after all the prep, I was working on my first
        projects, but something didn't feel right. Because of this simple
        approach I felt like I was scamming people. Honesty and loyalty have
        always been important virtues to me. I felt like I should add more value
        to people's businesses than just a fancy web design.
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided at least I should get more skill as a web developer. So in
        2019 I started saving up for the best web dev bootcamp in the country,
        Codaisseur. Even though only 35% are accepted and 70% graduate to
        Codaisseur, I had confidence I could easily make it. Well, it turns out
        it wasn't easy, but I did graduate and I definitely gave it my all.
      </p>
      <p>In May 2020 I graduated Codaisseur as a full stack developer.</p>
      <p>
        Before I'm reopening my own business, I want to work in a company as a
        web developer for a few years. I'm open to work as a back end dev, full
        stack dev, but my preference goes to a position in front end
        development.
      </p>
      <p>What do I have to offer?</p>
      <p>
        Understanding computers, logic and programming is like second nature to
        me. I've always been good at it and I always have a strong urge to
        improve the efficiency of things. I don't just want to know how to do
        something, but I want to know what the best way of doing something is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another thing I can offer is the speed at which I learn things. I
        realize that this ability is crucial in our field of work, as ours is
        one of the fastest changing fields of work out there. I can demonstrate
        my learning speed best by pointing at my portfolio project. The
        technologies I used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Redux, an ORM
        (sequelize), REST api (express js), database (postgreSQL), web hosting
        on heroku and netlify. I had hardly any prior experience with these
        techs, and I learned them in just 6 weeks time.
      </p>
      <p>What am I looking for in a job?</p>
      <p>
        I'm looking for a working environment with 2 ingredients: • an
        environment that encourages and pro-actively supports my learning
        process • an environment where communication isn't formal and strict,
        but open and lighthearted.
